A Red Hat / Fedora Linux user since 2002 (i.e., 13 y.o.)  
A heavy user/abuser of virtualization (since 2005), containerization (since 2013) and the Cloud (since 2012).  
Nonetheless, I mostly run Windows as a desktop, evading participation in Linux desktop holy wars.  
In reality, I'm quite often forced to bear with the horrible stuff I'm given like macOS or SAP...

`unshare` doesn't mean I don't share.
It's a reference to [unshare(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html) system call
that gives rise to Linux containers.  
(I've spent a significant amount of lifetime around Linux containers.)

My first-party code almost always comes with a comment like this (yes, I'm proudly a Russian):
> ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Made in Russia with love and care

In *Serenity* (2005), a protagonist said:
> Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down

I concur with Captain Reynolds, but I believe you can get much farther with love and care than you can with love alone.
